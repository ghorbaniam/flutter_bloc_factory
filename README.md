# flutter_bloc_factory
 There are two packages:
 * Bloc Factory
 * Widget Factory

 The idea is to use the factory design pattern in order to create a proper bloc to use. In this way you can have different blocs and use them based on a specific situation. Also, you can create a widget class for example based on the current platform.
 In the following you can find the schema of what I tried to explain above.
