# flutter_bloc_factory
 There are two packages:
 * Bloc Factory
 * Widget Factory

 The idea is to use the factory design pattern in order to crate the proper bloc to use. In this way you can have different blocs to replace based on a specific situation. Also, you can create a widget for example based on the current platform.
 In the following you can find the schema of what I tried to explain above.
